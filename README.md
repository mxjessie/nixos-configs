NixOS configs yeah!
===================

To install:
* move your existing /etc/nixos somewhere else
* clone this to /etc/nixos
* move your /etc/somewhereelse/hardware-configuration.nix into /etc/nixos
* symlink something in machines/ to configuration.nix (or cp & symlink)

Super work-in-progress and probably not entirely usable for anyone but me,
but posted here 'cos I would not have gotten as far as I have without the
configs other folx have posted on GitHub. Thanks, y'all.
